<h1>DS Mini-Assignment #3</h1>
<p>Create a program that stores words in an STL vector and then searches the vector for words.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You will keep track of strings as C++ string objects.</p>
<p>In main, declare a vector variable to contain your strings.&#160;</p>
<p>Create a loop that gets one word at a time from the user until they enter &quot;.&quot; as the only thing on the input line. For this assignment, it is adequate to limit strings to one word at a time. Put the word into the vector.</p>
<p>Once the user is done entering words, set up a separate loop to search for words in the vector. Similar to the previous loop, get the searchable words one at a time until they enter &quot;.&quot;. When you find the word, use printf() (or cout) to display &quot;Success!&quot;.&#160; If you don&#39;t find the word, use printf() (or cout) to display &quot;Not there!&quot;.&#160;</p>
<p>You should comment as normal.</p>
<h2>Submitting</h2>
<p>Call your source file mini3.cpp (you cannot use C for this).&#160;&#160;Do not create any other source files. Call your project mini3.exe.</p>
<p>Hand in your source file and .x (renamed .exe) file into the Mini 3 Dropbox once done.</p>
<p>This is not a regular Mini-Assignment, as it is due at midnight at the end of the last class next week.</p>
<p></p>
