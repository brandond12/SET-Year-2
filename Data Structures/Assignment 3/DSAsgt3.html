<h1>DS Assignment #3</h1>
<p>Rewrite assignment #1 to use the most appropriate STL containers instead of the linked lists.</p>
<p>You should use your code for Assignment #1 for this (but you are not required to do so) but you will have to <strong>remove</strong> all code that is not relevant to this assignment.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your code must work to the functional requirements of Assignment #1.</li>
<li>You must choose the <strong>most appropriate</strong> STL containers. Choosing a signficantly less appropriate one will cause you to lose marks.
  <ul>
    <li>Do <strong>not </strong>start this assignment until either all STL content has been covered in class <strong>or </strong>you have gone ahead in the slides to cover all STL content on your own.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Do not hand in  <strong>any </strong>linked list code. It must be removed completely from your source code files.</li>
<li>Do not leave in debugging output. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your program must compile without warnings. If you have to use a #pragma as stated in the C course notes in order to get rid of the Microsoft-specific warnings, you should do so.</li>
<li>Your executable must be named dsA3.exe (renamed to dsA3.x).</li>
<li>The source file that contains your main() function must be called dsA3.cpp.
<ul>
<li>If you want to create other source files, name them appropriately.</li>
<li>Remember to put appropriate header comments at the top of ALL source files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your code must meet the code standards specified in class, this semester and in the C course last semester.
<ul>
<li>If you did not take the C course, it is your responsiblility to read the C course notes and C assignment requirements so that you know what is expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit your source code and renamed executable to the appropriate D2L dropbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must use C++ since the STL is not available in C.</li>
</ul>
