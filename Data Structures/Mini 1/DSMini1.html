<h1>DS Mini-Assignment #1</h1>
<p>Change the first class&#39;s exercise to store the information in a simple linked list instead of an array.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>In main, instead of an array of 10 structs, declare a head pointer to a linked list. The linked list node should have two fields: a struct containing the SongInfo information and a pointer to the next node in the linked list.</p>
<p>The rest of the program is the same, except that you are replacing the array with the linked list.</p>
<p>You should comment as normal.</p>
<h2>Submitting</h2>
<p>Call your primary source file mini1.c or mini1.cpp.&#160; Put your linked list code into linkedList.c or linkedList.cpp (or linkedList.h if you use a class).&#160; Put any other code into your already-existing mini1.c or mini1.cpp. You can create any .h files you need in order to support this.&#160; Call your project mini1.exe.</p>
<p>Hand in your source files and .x (renamed .exe) file into the Mini 1 Dropbox once done.</p>
<p>This is not a regular Mini-Assignment, as it is due at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
