<h1>Computer Security</h1>
<h1>Presentation #1</h1>
<p>Find a (uniquely-chosen) computer security-related discussion area on the Internet and do a presentation giving a synopsis of the discussion area and some of the topics discussed in the previous two to eight weeks.</p>
<h2>"Discussion Area"</h2>
<ul>
<li>A "discussion area" can be a website, blog, mailing list, newsgroup, etc.
<ul>
<li>It must be active (i.e. with postings or topic updates within the past 4 months).</li>
<li>It must have enough content so that your presentation will be at least 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two presentations cannot be about the same "discussion area".</li>
<li>This is done in pairs. You must select your partner by the time you select your topic.
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a partner, post to the eConestoga "Discussion Forum: Finding a Group Partner".</li>
<li>If you have a partner, post to the eConestoga &quot;Discussion Forum: I Found a Partner&quot;.
  <ul>
    <li>Everyone who does not have a partner by midnight on Thursday in Week 3 will be assigned a partner.
      <ul>
        <li>If there is an odd number of students in the class, the student left at the end of the partner assigning process will present on their own.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>You should exchange as much contact information as is possible with your partner. Do not rely on only one method of communication.
  <ul>
  <li>It is almost a certainty that some groups will have enormous problems with communication. Don't let this be your group.</li>
  <li>It is OK to ask your partner the serious question "do you intend on working on this seriously?"</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must post to the eConestoga "Presentation #1 Partners and Discussion Areas" blog with information about what your chosen "discussion area" is (including URL) so that it can be approved.
<ul>
<li>If you cannot find a partner, you should not post a topic. Instead, you should post to the "Discussion Forum for Finding a Group Partner". You must do this <strong>before </strong>the Thursday deadline for finding a partner..</li>
<li>You must have a Discussion Group selected by 11:59 p.m on Monday in Week 4 (otherwise your mark will be capped at 50%). This is the topic approval deadline.
  <ul>
<li>If you do not have a partner and discussion area by 11:59 p.m on Wednesday in Week 4, you will not be allowed to present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It cannot be from a discussion area that is required reading for the course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sequence of Presentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be ready to go at the start of your time, with your presentation on a memory stick or CD and a backup of your presentation on another medium. There will not be enough time to allow you to log into your computer account.
<ul>
<li>You will have access to the Internet unless something goes wrong. However,<strong> it is expected that you will have static images of your site available</strong> in case you can't get access to the live site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start with an introduction to the discussion area.</li>
<li>Discuss the computer security-related items discussed over the past two to eight weeks, with a brief synopsis of the discussions.
<ul>
<li>You do not have to mention all items discussed if it would cause your presentation to be longer than 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss biases and assumptions associated with the discussion area.</li>
<li>You must end with a synopsis of your impression about the discussion area .</li>
<li>The presentation itself should be 5 to 10 minutes in length.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The object of the presentation is to get students to find out about different online resources with respect to security.&nbsp; This is achieved by the act of trying to find an appropriate blog, website, or newsgroup, etc., listening to others present about what they&rsquo;ve discovered, listening to what the topics that are being discussed are, and &nbsp;learning about biases, quality, etc. of resources that are out there.&nbsp; So you do have to talk about the blog, etc. itself before getting into the topics discussed there.&nbsp; Afterwards, you should discuss things like the biases and angles that are taken on the topics, etc.&nbsp; As you would likely be able to figure, the biases and assumptions associated with a blog found on the Washington Post website would be quite different from rootkits.org.&nbsp; Yet, both types of resources are very important to know about.&nbsp; So, I hope that it&rsquo;s clearer now that the medium (e.g. blog) is <strong>far</strong> more important than the message (e.g. topics) in this particular presentation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like an illustration of the &ldquo;give a man a fish vs. teach a man to fish&rdquo; principle&hellip;</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>20% Content</li>
<li>20% Organization (including being too short or too long)</li>
<li>20% Delivery
<ul>
<li>It is expected that both group members will present. It is not required that presentation be split exactly evenly but a 75/25 (or worse) split will result in a lower delivery mark for the group member presenting less.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>20% Visual Format</li>
<li>20% Subjective</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There will be peer evaluations as well, worth 25% of your mark for this assignment. Peer marks will be scaled. It is expected that you attend and evaluate all presentations. If you do not, your presentation mark will be penalized based on how many presentations you did not attend and evaluate.&nbsp; In addition, giving all presentations similar marks will result in your mark being negatively affected.</li>
<li>You must submit your presentation to the eConestoga dropbox by the end of the Sunday before the presentation. If you do not, you will lose 20 marks if you submit it late. If you do not submit it within two days after your presentation, you will lose 50 marks.
  <ul>
<li>If one person did most or all of the work, e-mail me to indicate that. Discussions will ensue that might end up with a redistribution of the mark between the two group members.</li>
</ul>
